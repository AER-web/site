            <p>Miss A felt something was not quite right in part of her body and undertook some investigation work and a health scan. 
                It transpired that she had the breast cancer. This was the second time that she had a serous health issue, the first was when
                she was in her twenties and due to that experience of the western health service system, she decided to embark upon the natural
                holistic route for cancer treatment, reduction and elimination.</p>

                <br></br>

            <p>This site provides the care plan that she adopted for over seven years and during that period, she was defined as having stage four
                cancer for over five years. There was clear evidence that the natural holistic treatment plan was working in reducing the cancer
                and the tumours. By way of example, in the third quarter of 2024, Miss A had an MRI scan and from the results, the consultant doctor
                explained the areas and size of the cancer in her body. </p>

                <br></br>

            <p>Miss A then repeated the same scan twelve months later and out of the four areas where the cancer was present, in two of those areas, 
                the cancer size had not increased, but the other two areas, the size of the cancer had in fact reduced. The consultant doctor said to
                Miss A whist explaining the results, <i>“whatever you are doing, please continue to do it, as its working. I cannot explain why”</i>. </p>

                <br></br>

            <p>Although she sadly passed away, the issue that resulted from her passing, was not because her treatment plan was not working, it was 
                because a side issue materialised in her body that resulted in substantial blood loss on three occasions over a period of five months.</p>

                <br></br>

            <p>This site is dedicated to Miss A, she was a strong, independent, determined, loving, caring, inspiring and spiritual woman and it is hoped
                that those who read the contents of this site, will be encouraged to consider other natural paths in their own journey and lifestyle choices.
                Always question, fact check, think for yourself, when a medical professional recommends a treatment.</p>

                <br></br>

            <p>The treatments of chemotherapy and radiation therapy kill all the human cells in the body, regardless of whether they are good or bad cells.</p>
